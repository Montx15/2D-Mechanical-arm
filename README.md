# 2D-Mechanical-arm
This project has been designed to recreate the 2-D movement of a mechanical arm. By creating a code (processing) in the Arduino software, you can program 3 servomotors.  Using 2 buttons for each actuator, they can be ordered to turn to one side or the other within a range of 180 degrees.
